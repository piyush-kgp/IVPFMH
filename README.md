# Image and Video Processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a Stop at the Hospital

This repository contains slides, quizzes and code that I wrote for the Coursera course titled "Image and Video Processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a Stop at the Hospital" taught by [Prof. Guillermo Sapiro](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/guillermo-sapiro) who is associated with Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University.

For the purpose of academic integrity, this repository is being kept private. My intention of keeping all this online is to be able to refer or revise the material at a later time.
