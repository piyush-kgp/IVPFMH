# Optional programming exercises

- Use the level-sets method to implement constant motion. Consider simply an image as the embedding function and deform it according to the corresponding equation, <img src="assets/eq1.svg">. Implement also <img src="assets/eq2.svg">. Observe the result of both cases for different evolution intervals.
- Repeat the above exercise but now for each level set moving according to curvature motion.
- Repeat the above two exercises for a circular shape, meaning create the initial embedding function to be a binary image with a certain value inside a disk and a different value outside of it.
- Implement the basic equation of the active contours and test it on some images with simple objects. Initialize the evolving curve in different forms for more testing.
