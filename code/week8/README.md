# Optional programming exercises

- Download and experiment with the sparse modeling free software packages linked in the class website.
- Compare the results of sparse modeling image denoising with those of DCT-based image denoising as implemented in ipol.im
- Consider an image and select K patches from it as the dictionary; select those patches at random. With this dictionary perform sparse modeling image denoising and compare with the results obtained when learning the dictionary.
- Pick a particular example of sparse modeling image denoising and experiment with different dictionary sizes. Plot the histogram of atoms usage, meaning the number of times each atom is used considering all image patches.
